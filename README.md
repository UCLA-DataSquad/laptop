DSC - DataSquad Laptop Setup (for MacBook)
======

**Laptop** is a script to set up a macOS laptop for data science tools for DSC staff & Data Squad.

* It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
* It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.


Requirements
------------

This script supports:

* macOS Big Sur (11.2) - Apple Silicon 

To make backward compatable we need to add some logic to test for architecture. 

NOTE: Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon rather than `/usr/local` so `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` probably needs to be dependant on the architecture. see: <https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/589>

* macOS Mavericks (10.9)
* macOS Yosemite (10.10)
* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)
* macOS Catalina (10.15)

Older versions may work but aren't tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

To Install
-------

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLA-DataSquad/laptop/master/mac
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

You'll need to use your laptop password. If it's the first time running this script, it will trigger an installation of Xcode and you will need to hit return. 

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dotfiles][dotfiles].

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
